# Scoring Logic

Total Score: 100

- Code Quality: 25%
- Project Structure: 20%
- Documentation: 15%
- Test Coverage: 15%
- Real-World Applicability: 15%
- Commit Consistency: 10%

SonarCloud metrics such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells are used to deduct points.

Example:
Base Score = 100
Bugs (3 × 5) = -15
Code Smells (10 × 2) = -20

Final Score = 65 / 100
