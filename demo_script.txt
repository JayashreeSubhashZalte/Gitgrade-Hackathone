This project is GitGrade, an AI-powered GitHub repository evaluation system.
We start by providing a public GitHub repository URL.
The system uses GitHub APIs and SonarCloud to analyze code quality, structure,
documentation, testing, and commit history.
Based on real metrics, we generate a score, a written summary,
and a personalized improvement roadmap.
This helps students understand their strengths and weaknesses
from a recruiter’s perspective.
